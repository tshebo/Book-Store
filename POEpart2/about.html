            <h2>Welcome to ReuseBooks</h2>
            <p>We are Tsheboeng Sereetsi and Alicia Mavunda, software development students at Rosebank College. We have created ReuseBooks as a solution for the campus library to facilitate the buying and selling of books among students.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to provide a convenient and accessible platform for students to find and purchase the books they need for their studies, as well as to enable students to sell their own books to their peers. By connecting buyers and sellers within the campus community, we aim to make the process of acquiring and disposing of books more efficient and cost-effective.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Our platform allows students to browse through a wide selection of books available for sale. Students can search for books by title, author, genre, or ISBN. Once they find a book they are interested in, they can view detailed information about the book, including the condition, price, and description.</p>
            <p>If a student decides to purchase a book, they can contact the seller through our platform to arrange the transaction. We provide a secure messaging system to facilitate communication between buyers and sellers.</p>
            <p>For students who want to sell their own books, we offer a simple process to create a listing. Sellers can provide all the necessary details about the book, including its condition, price, and any additional information they want to share.</p>
